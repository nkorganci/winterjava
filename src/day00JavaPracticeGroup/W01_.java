* Review "format print" with GroceryList program that's done in Office Hours

Q-1) Write a program that prompts the user to enter numbers. Put them in a list.
 Then prints each integer with their occurrences.(Use Lambda)

Q-2) Majority element in an array. You are given an array which has numbers inside.
 You find the element that occurs more than half of the array.

If there is no such element return 0. Suppose the array doesn't contain 0.
For example if the array is {1,1,2,3} than your program should return 0
Because the occurrence of "1" is not greater than 2 which is half of the array length. (2>2) is false
If the array is {1,2,2,2,3} than your program should return 2
